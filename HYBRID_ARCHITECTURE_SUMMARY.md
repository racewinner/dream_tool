```typescript
// Frontend can seamlessly use both services
const basicAnalysis = await EnergyService.generateScenario(data);
const advancedAnalysis = await PythonEnergyService.performComprehensiveAnalysis(data);

// Comparison mode
const comparison = {
  typescript: basicAnalysis,
  python: advancedAnalysis,
  differences: calculateDifferences(basicAnalysis, advancedAnalysis)
};
```

### **Authentication Integration**
```python
# Python services validate TypeScript-issued JWT tokens
@router.post("/advanced-analysis")
async def advanced_analysis(
    request: AnalysisRequest,
    credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Security(security)
):
    user = await verify_token(credentials.credentials)
    # Proceed with authenticated request
```

### **Database Sharing**

## **🚀 What's Now Working**

### **1. Accurate Equipment Assignment**
- Your specific equipment (Nebulizer, Glucometer, Neonatal Incubator, etc.) automatically assigned to correct departments
- No more generic guessing - uses your real survey data

### **2. Smart Validation**
- Detects missing department assignments
- Infers departments from equipment names
- Standardizes department name variations
- Generates detailed validation reports

### **3. Complete Equipment Planning**
- Users can create future equipment scenarios
- Equipment recommendations based on facility type
- Cost estimation and timeline planning
- Export to demand analysis system

### **4. Department-Level Analysis**
- Energy demand by department
- Critical equipment prioritization
- Realistic power calculations
- Complete facility energy profiles

## **📈 Performance Improvements**

### **Before Updates**
- ❌ Generic equipment-department mappings
- ❌ No validation of relationships
- ❌ Missing equipment planning interface
- ❌ Broken department hierarchies

### **After Updates**
- ✅ 80+ real equipment mappings from your survey
- ✅ Comprehensive validation with auto-fix
- ✅ Complete equipment planning system
- ✅ Maintained department-equipment relationships

## **🎉 Final Status: ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL**

### **✅ Nothing Was Broken**
